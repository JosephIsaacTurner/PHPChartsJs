## Neuro 316 Final Exam

**1. What is the best way to prepare for and successfully present yourself and your message to your class audience? What do you think made for the strongest presentations in class? Be sure to include some Do's and Don'ts! Provide a 5-8 sentence paragraph (minimum) answering this question and giving advice that you think would be particularly helpful to an incoming Neuro 316 student.**

    I believe it is important that you select an area of research that you are personally invested in, especially something that would be interesting and informative to others. I enjoyed the presentations of students who seemed genuinely interested and knowledgeable about their topic. Make sure you are decently prepared in advance before you present, so that you don't feel flustered or disorganized while presenting. Don't rely on your poster or notes as you present, but have a good internal understanding of what you will talk about. I think the hardest part is getting the body language right, as this is what I found to be most challenging. I think practice makes perfect, so my best advice is just to practice multiple times beforehand.

**2. How does one develop a good thesis statement (i.e. what components make a strong thesis statement) and how does a thesis statement differ from a purpose statement? How might your thesis statement develop/emerge during the research and writing process over the course of the semester? Provide a 5-8 sentence paragraph (minimum) answering this question and giving advice.**

    A good thesis statement clearly communicates the main point or argument of your paper. An effective thesis is specific, arguable, and provides focus for your paper. My thesis statement emerged as I conducted research and began to formulate my own perspective on the topic. Initially I had only a broad purpose statement, but after reading several scholarly sources, I was able to state my viewpoint more precisely. I would advise students to begin with a purpose statement and refine it into a clear, concise thesis as their understanding develops through research and outlining. An articulate thesis statement is invaluable for maintaining focus while writing.

**3. What advice would you give to an incoming student who is looking to gain courage and skill in reading professional, peer-reviewed journal articles? Please share any advice, tips, tricks, or experiences you had while tackling reading journal articles this semester. Provide a 5-8 sentence paragraph (minimum) answering this question and giving advice that you think would be particularly helpful**

    Don't be be intimidated by the the articles! It can be daunting at first, but remember, everyone starts somewhere. I found it helpful to first skim the article to get a general sense of its structure and key points. Pay special attention to the abstract, introduction, and conclusion, as these sections often encapsulate the main arguments and findings. Another tip is to not get bogged down by every detail on your first read. It's okay if you don't understand everything right away. I often had to read articles multiple times to fully grasp the concepts. Lastly, keep a glossary of terms that are new to you. It helped me build my vocabulary and understanding of the field.

**4. What does it mean to synthesis research and why it is crucial to creating a strong argument when writing a literature review paper? Provide a 5-8 sentence paragraph (minimum) answering this question and giving advice that you think would be particularly helpful.**


    Synthesis is about more than just summarizing different studies; it's about integrating various pieces of research to form a coherent narrative or argument. It's like putting together a puzzle where each study is a piece, and you're trying to see the bigger picture they all create when connected. In my experience, the key to a strong literature review is to identify themes, trends, and gaps in the research. This helps in building a narrative that's not just a list of studies, but an insightful discussion. It's also important to critically evaluate the studies, not just report them. Ask yourself how they contribute to the field, what their limitations are, and how they relate to each other. This level of analysis makes your paper much more compelling and shows that you're engaging with the material at a deeper level.

**5. In writing for neuroscience, following a standardized writing style (e.g., APA) and good grammar are essential to achieving a high level of professionalism in communication. Discuss the resources and class experiences that have been most useful for you in developing skills in these areas. Where might you go for additional information if you have questions in the future about APA formatting or good grammar practices? Be sure to provide a response to all parts of the question/prompt and each short essay should be a minimum of two 5-8 sentence paragraphs in length.**

    One of the most useful resources for me was the APA Publication Manual. It's the comprehensive guide for formatting, citation, and overall writing style for APA. Initially, it felt overwhelming, but I became more familiar and comfortable with the guidelines. Another invaluable resource was our class writing workshops about APA standards. These really helped me understand the practical application of APA rules and how to avoid common mistakes. 

    For grammar, I found the Purdue OWL website to be very helpful. It has a lot of great resources and explanations for grammar rules. In addition to these resources, simply reading your writing out loud and having others proofread it can help you catch mistakes. And while reading out loud is helpful, you should also know that technical writing requires more precise language than conversational speech. You need to be very careful with word choice and sentence structure. Beware of run-on sentences and convoluted phrasing!

**6. Discuss your personal philosophy of revision (of written work) and rehearsal (for oral presentation) as they have developed over the course of the semester. While some college assignments or speaking assignments might not demand extensive revision or rehearsal in order to meet basic requirements, why might one choose to invest time, energy and careful thought into developing a more professional type of writing or high-level oral presentation? What might be the personal benefits for doing so? Be sure to provide a response to all parts of the question/prompt and each short essay should be a minimum of two 5-8 sentence paragraphs in length.**

    I used to think that if I wrote something once, it was very close to good enough, and that rehearsing for a presentation meant just going over my slides a couple of times. However, I've learned that both writing and speaking are crafts that improve immensely with careful revision and practice. For my written assignments, I now make a point to write a first draft, then step away from it for a day or two. When I return to it with fresh eyes, I can better see where improvements are needed. I think the number one takeaway from this class was that good writing and revision aren't just about elegant prose and good grammar. It's about clarity of thought and organization of ideas. I've learned to be more intentional about the structure of my writing and to make sure that my ideas flow logically.

    As for presentations, rehearsal has become about more than just memorizing what I'm going to say. It's about understanding my material deeply so that I can communicate it effectively and engage with my audience. Practicing in front of friends or even with the recording app on my phone has helped me refine not just what I say, but how I say it, especially tone and pacing. Investing time and energy into developing a more professional writing style and high-level presentation skills builds confidence in my ability to communicate effectively, an essential skill in any career. I think audiences deserve a well-thought-out and polished delivery of information. Personally, the satisfaction and confidence I gain from knowing I've done my best are immense. 

**7. When reviewing an empirical study for inclusion in a literature review, what particular components of the study should be examined to assess its strength and the advisability of using it in a literature review? Describe two Questionable Research Practices you should be on the lookout for in the research you evaluate and also describe two open science practices that are aimed at resolving/discouraging these practices. From your experience in this class, give examples of elements that convinced you to use one article, but not to use another. Be sure to provide a response to all parts of the question/prompt and each short essay should be a minimum of two 5-8 sentence paragraphs in length.**


    Throughout this semester, I learned the importance of thoroughly evaluating empirical studies for my literature review. I paid close attention to the methodology to ensure that the study was conducted rigorously, especially since my topic was about research methods. I made careful note of statistical techniques and analyses. My research topic itself was about establishing causation, so I was particularly interested in whether research findings were correlational or causal. Understanding the distinction between correlation and causation, and identifying causal relationships from empirical research, is really important for making compelling arguments in a literature review.

    Regarding questionable research practices, there are two that I will mention: P-hacking and HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known). P-hacking involves manipulating data or statistical analyses until nonsignificant findings appear significant. HARKing is creating or modifying hypotheses after seeing the results, giving a false impression of prediction accuracy. To counter these, open science practices like pre-registering studies and sharing data openly are crucial. Pre-registration involves declaring hypotheses and analysis plans before conducting research, which helps prevent p-hacking and HARKing. Open data also allows for greater scrutiny and replication of findings. I think every key study that I reviewed in my paper had open data and open code available, which was very helpful in my evaluation. These studies were also very transparent about the causal claims they were making, which helped me determine whether to use them in my paper. I also surveyed some bad examples of studies that made causal claims without sufficient evidence, and I avoided them or used them as examples of bad research claims for my paper.

**8. On a scale of 1-10 (ten being the best), where did you rate yourself at the beginning of the course as a writer in neuroscience? Explain where you see yourself now on this same scale. Discuss three major skills you feel you have strengthened during this course and list one goal for future growth. Be sure to provide a response to all parts of the question/prompt and each short essay should be a minimum of two 5-8 sentence paragraphs in length.**

    At the beginning of this class, I believe that I rated myself as a 7. I had a decent grasp on the fundamentals of writing, but I knew there was room for improvement, especially in the context of scientific writing. Now I'd confidently place myself at a 9. This improvement stems from refining several key skills throughout the semester. I feel well-equipped to apply these skills to achieve my goals of publishing research and presenting at conferences.

    The first major skill I enhanced was my ability to critically evaluate and integrate scientific literature. Before, I used to summarize articles without deeply analyzing their implications or how they fit into the broader context of my topic. Now, I've learned to dissect studies more critically, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and their relevance to my research question. This skill has made my writing more insightful and grounded in solid evidence.

    The second skill I developed was in structuring and organizing my writing. Initially, my papers were sometimes a collection of ideas without a clear narrative flow. This class taught me the importance of a logical structure - starting with a strong thesis, followed by a well thought-out argument, and ending with a summary that ties everything together. I believe my writing is more cohesive and persuasive as a result.

    Thirdly, I honed my ability to present scientific ideas, especially for poster presentations. I was able to hone my visual design skills to create figures and posters that are more visually appealing, even though I have no natural artistic talent. I think my confidence in explaining complex ideas to an audience is higher after preparing and presenting my poster in class.

    For future growth, my goal is to continue writing and developing my ideas. My literature review is a good starting point for a primary research article that I am currently writing and hope to publish in a few weeks. I also plan to present my research at conferences next year. I'm excited to continue developing my writing skills and applying them to my future career. I feel equipped with a strong foundation in scientific writing and communication that will serve me well as I pursue research and share my findings.

**9. List one element of this class that may have come as a surprise to you (something that you did not expect to learn, an experience you didn’t expect to have, an accomplishment you didn’t think you could achieve, etc.). Share this experience and tell how its effects might be helpful to you in the future. Be sure to provide a response to all parts of the question/prompt and each short essay should be a minimum of two 5-8 sentence paragraphs in length.**

    One element of this class that surprised me was the poster presentation. I knew this was a neuroscience writing course, but I wasn't expecting to do any public speaking or presenting. At first I thought it would be simple and straightforward, but I quickly realized that it was a lot more challenging than I expected. I had to think carefully about how to present my research in a way that was concise and engaging. My research topic was pretty extensive and abstract, so I had to figure out how to explain it in a way that was accessible to a general audience. I believe I was able to do a pretty good job, but I'm sure there's room for improvement with additional practice. I also had to design a poster that was visually appealing and easy to understand, which was very time consuming. 

    Being able to present with confidence was also really tricky, as I am not a natural public speaker and have very little experience with it. I wish I had prepared more in advance to get more comfortable with presenting and receive feedback. Overall, I'm glad I had this experience because I know that I'll have to present my research at conferences in the future. Not only that, but confident delivery of information is a valuable skill in any situation. Hopefully I can continue to improve my presentation skills and become a more effective communicator.


**10. At professional neuroscience conferences, presenters may use slides (i.e., Powerpoint, etc.) to share findings from the latest research with other professionals. Discuss two specific elements you feel would be helpful for others to remember in preparing the visual element (PowerPoint slide) of their presentation. Also discuss a literature review oral presentation given in class that you thought was excellent and describe what you feel made it effective. Be sure to provide a response to all parts of the question/prompt and each short essay should be a minimum of two 5-8 sentence paragraphs in length.**

    When preparing PowerPoint slides for a conference, two specific elements are crucial. Firstly, clarity and simplicity in slide design are key. It's tempting to pack slides with information, but I've learned that too much text or overly complex diagrams can overwhelm the audience. Instead, slides should complement your research paper, not duplicate it. Using clear, concise bullet points and easy-to-understand graphs or images can make a big difference for your audience's comprehension. Additionally, be sure to use legible fonts and cohesive color schemes in your slide design. 

    Secondly, it is important to emphasize storytelling through slides or posters. Each slide (or element in your poster) should contribute to a narrative that guides the audience through the research. This means logically sequencing the elements in your presentation to build upon each other, leading the audience from the introduction, through the methodology and results, to the conclusion and implications of the research. Effective storytelling also involves highlighting the key findings and their significance in the field, making the presentation memorable and impactful. An impactful presentation tells a story that sticks with the audience long after it is over.  

    Regarding an excellent literature review oral presentation in our class, one of my peers really set the bar high. I believe her name was McKenzie Bellon. Her presentation on gliomas was not only informative but also exceptionally delivered. What made it so memorable was her combination of confident delivery and deep understanding of the subject matter.
